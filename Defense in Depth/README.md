Defense in Depth Lab (DID-lab) ‚Äì Azure

This project demonstrates a defense in depth (DiD) architecture in Microsoft Azure by deploying and securing a web application, integrating it with Azure Front Door, Key Vault, Entra ID (Azure AD), Log Analytics, and Microsoft Sentinel. The lab simulates real-world SOC monitoring and security enforcement.

‚∏ª

üìå Lab Objectives
	‚Ä¢	Deploy a secure Azure Web App (Python runtime).
	‚Ä¢	Protect with Front Door + WAF.
	‚Ä¢	Enforce Access Restrictions (IP allow/deny).
	‚Ä¢	Centralize logging in Log Analytics Workspace (LAW).
	‚Ä¢	Enable Sentinel detections & dashboards.
	‚Ä¢	Secure secrets in Key Vault with managed identity.
	‚Ä¢	Monitor Entra ID sign-ins and audit logs.

‚∏ª

üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview
	1.	Azure Web App (DID-lab-WEB)
	2.	Azure Front Door (global entry, WAF rules)
	3.	Key Vault (secrets, RBAC access)
	4.	Entra ID (auth & SSO)
	5.	Log Analytics Workspace (central logs)
	6.	Sentinel (threat detection & response)

üöÄ Deployment Steps

1. Deploy Web App
	‚Ä¢	Provisioned via Azure Portal under DID-lab-RG.
	‚Ä¢	Configured with Python 3.13 runtime.


‚∏ª

2. Configure Networking & Access Restrictions
	‚Ä¢	Applied allow/deny IP rules.
	‚Ä¢	Verified 403 blocks for unauthorized IPs.


‚∏ª

3. Enable Diagnostics ‚Üí Log Analytics
	‚Ä¢	Sent HTTP, Console, Application logs to LAW.
	‚Ä¢	Confirmed logs with KQL queries.

AppServiceHTTPLogs
| summarize Hits=count() by ScStatus
| order by Hits desc


‚∏ª

4. Deploy Key Vault
	‚Ä¢	Created DID-Key-Vault-KV.
	‚Ä¢	Applied Azure RBAC for access.
	‚Ä¢	Configured diagnostic logging to LAW.


‚∏ª

5. Enable Entra ID Authentication
	‚Ä¢	Configured Entra ID login for App Service.
	‚Ä¢	Verified redirect and token-based access.


‚∏ª

6. Log Analytics & Sentinel Integration
	‚Ä¢	Connected App Service + Key Vault + Entra ID logs to LAW.
	‚Ä¢	Enabled Sentinel detections for failed logins and suspicious access.


‚∏ª

üìä Example KQL Queries

Failed Logins (401, 404)

AppServiceHTTPLogs
| where ScStatus in (401,404)
| summarize Count=count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 10m)

Blocked IPs

AppServiceHTTPLogs
| where ScStatus == 403
| summarize Blocked=count() by ClientIP, bin(TimeGenerated, 10m)

Key Vault Access

AzureDiagnostics
| where ResourceType == "VAULTS"
| where OperationName == "SecretGet"
| summarize Accesses=count() by CallerIPAddress, Caller, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)

üõ°Ô∏è Defense in Depth Achievements
	‚Ä¢	Network Security ‚Üí IP restrictions + private endpoints.
	‚Ä¢	Identity Security ‚Üí Entra ID authentication + audit logs.
	‚Ä¢	Application Security ‚Üí Web App behind Front Door + WAF.
	‚Ä¢	Secrets Management ‚Üí Key Vault with RBAC + monitoring.
	‚Ä¢	Monitoring & Detection ‚Üí Sentinel queries, rules, dashboards.

‚∏ª

üìå Next Improvements
	‚Ä¢	Complete Front Door WAF policy enforcement.
	‚Ä¢	Enable Defender for App Service & Key Vault.
	‚Ä¢	Build Sentinel Workbooks for dashboards.
	‚Ä¢	Automate response with Logic Apps.
