# Defense-in-Depth (DID) Lab â€“ Azure Web App Security

This project demonstrates a **Defense-in-Depth (DID)** approach using Azure services.  
I deployed a basic web application and applied multiple security layers: **Identity**, **Perimeter**, **Secrets/Data**, and **Monitoring/Detection**.

## ðŸ”¹ Layers Implemented

### 1. Identity
- Integrated the web app with **Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)** for authentication.  
- Configured **App Service Authentication** to enforce logins.  
- Enabled **Microsoft Entra ID Connector** in Sentinel to ingest:
  - Sign-in Logs (tracks user logons)  
  - Audit Logs (tracks admin changes)

### 2. Perimeter
- Configured **App Service Access Restrictions** to only allow traffic from my trusted IP.  
- Verified **403 Forbidden blocks** when accessing from untrusted sources (VPN).  
- Created an **Analytics Rule** in Sentinel to detect repeated unauthorized or suspicious access attempts.

### 3. Data / Secrets
- Created an **Azure Key Vault** to store sensitive values instead of hardcoding secrets.  
- Granted my Web Appâ€™s **Managed Identity** the `Key Vault Secrets User` role.  
- Configured **Application Settings** in App Service to reference Key Vault secrets.  
- Enabled **Key Vault diagnostic logs** to monitor access attempts.

### 4. Monitoring / Detection
- Connected the Web App and Key Vault diagnostic logs to my **Log Analytics Workspace (LAW)**.  
- Integrated **Azure Sentinel** to centralize monitoring and generate incidents.  
- Built detection rules to alert on:
  - Repeated failed web requests  
  - Excessive failed Entra ID sign-ins  
  - Unauthorized Key Vault access attempts

## ðŸ”¹ Lab Highlights
- âœ… **Defense in Depth applied:** Identity, Perimeter, Data, and Monitoring layers.  
- âœ… **Real-world detections:** Access restriction bypass attempts, failed logins, and secret access monitoring.  
- âœ… **Azure native tools:** App Service, Entra ID, Key Vault, Log Analytics, Sentinel.  
- âœ… **Actionable alerts:** Automatic Sentinel incidents tied to suspicious activity.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Resume Bullets (Example)
- Implemented Azure **Defense-in-Depth lab** with Identity, Perimeter, and Data layers.  
- Integrated **Microsoft Entra ID** for authentication, **Key Vault** for secret management, and **Sentinel** for threat detection.  
- Built monitoring rules that raised alerts on **unauthorized access attempts** and **failed logins**.

## ðŸ“· Screenshots
All screenshots are stored in my [Google Drive Defense in Depth folder](<link-to-your-google-drive-folder>).  
This README embeds the most relevant ones with their file names for reference.

## ðŸ”¹ Next Steps
- Add **Azure Front Door with WAF** for advanced perimeter defense.  
- Expand Sentinel rules with MITRE ATT&CK mapping.  
- Automate deployments using **Bicep/ARM templates** or **Terraform**.
