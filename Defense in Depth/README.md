# Defense in Depth Lab (DID-lab) ‚Äì Azure

This project demonstrates a **defense in depth (DiD) architecture** in Microsoft Azure by deploying and securing a web application, integrating it with **Azure Front Door, Key Vault, Entra ID (Azure AD), Log Analytics, and Microsoft Sentinel**. The lab simulates real-world SOC monitoring and security enforcement.

---

## üìå Lab Objectives
- Deploy a secure Azure Web App (Python runtime).
- Protect with **Front Door + WAF**.
- Enforce **Access Restrictions** (IP allow/deny).
- Centralize logging in **Log Analytics Workspace (LAW)**.
- Enable **Sentinel detections & dashboards**.
- Secure secrets in **Key Vault** with managed identity.
- Monitor **Entra ID sign-ins and audit logs**.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview
1. **Azure Web App** (DID-lab-WEB)  
2. **Azure Front Door** (global entry, WAF rules)  
3. **Key Vault** (secrets, RBAC access)  
4. **Entra ID** (auth & SSO)  
5. **Log Analytics Workspace** (central logs)  
6. **Sentinel** (threat detection & response)

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy Web App
- Provisioned via Azure Portal under **DID-lab-RG**.
- Configured with **Python 3.13** runtime.

---

### 2. Configure Networking & Access Restrictions
- Applied **allow/deny IP rules**.
- Verified 403 blocks for unauthorized IPs.

---

### 3. Enable Diagnostics ‚Üí Log Analytics
- Sent **HTTP, Console, Application logs** to LAW.
- Confirmed logs with KQL queries.

```kusto
AppServiceHTTPLogs
| summarize Hits=count() by ScStatus
| order by Hits desc
```

---

### 4. Deploy Key Vault
- Created **DID-Key-Vault-KV**.
- Applied **Azure RBAC** for access.
- Configured diagnostic logging to LAW.

---

### 5. Enable Entra ID Authentication
- Configured **Entra ID login** for App Service.
- Verified redirect and token-based access.

---

### 6. Log Analytics & Sentinel Integration
- Connected **App Service + Key Vault + Entra ID logs** to LAW.
- Enabled **Sentinel detections** for failed logins and suspicious access.

## üìä Example KQL Queries

### Failed Logins (401, 404)
```kusto
AppServiceHTTPLogs
| where ScStatus in (401,404)
| summarize Count=count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 10m)
```

### Blocked IPs
```kusto
AppServiceHTTPLogs
| where ScStatus == 403
| summarize Blocked=count() by ClientIP, bin(TimeGenerated, 10m)
```

### Key Vault Access
```kusto
AzureDiagnostics
| where ResourceType == "VAULTS"
| where OperationName == "SecretGet"
| summarize Accesses=count() by CallerIPAddress, Caller, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
```
